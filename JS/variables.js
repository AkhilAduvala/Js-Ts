/* 
    A variable is a container for storing data in memory. 
    In JavaScript, we use let, const, and var to declare variables.

    var	has Function Scope, can be reassignable and hoisted(with undefined). Avoid using it (outdated)
    let	Block Scope, can be reassignable but not hoisted. Use When value changes over time
    const	Block Scope, can't be reassignable or hoisted. Use When value should never change

var city;
